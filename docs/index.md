# Welcome to Learn Java

## Goal

The goal of this website is go from no prior experience to coding a simple text adventure game. Note that this format purposefully simply has goals and hints for each section, and there isn't a huge amount of teaching. This is because a big part of coding is learning from google, stackoverflow, documentation, and ChatGPT.

## Use of AI

Note that these assignments would likely be simple enough for ChatGPT to solve. Thus, I recommend that any questions to ChatGPT should not be specific to this project. Ask broad, general questions which could apply to any project, not just this one. In addition, I recommend that you never copy/paste from the site or your code to ChatGPT, or from ChatGPT to your code. It is up to you to follow these heuristics, these are only recommendations for you to maximize your learning

# Step 2: Variables and Arithmetic

## 2.1: First Operation
First, given variables `damage` and `number_of_hits`, print the total damage dealt.

## 2.2: More Operations
Next, given variables `opponent_health`, `opponent_damage`, `opponent_shield`, `player_health`, `player_damage`, and `player_shield`, calculate the damage dealt by the opponent on the player. Damage dealt is calculated as `damage - shield`. Store the damage dealt in a variable called `damage_dealt`. Subtract this damage from the player's health and print their new health to console.

## 2.3: Integer Division
Calculate the number of hits it will take to defeat the opponent. You may NOT use any imports. Use casting and integer division.

## 2.4: Update a variable
You received a powerbuff! Increase the player's damage by 30%. Then, calculate the opponent's new health if the player deals a hit.
